    <h1>Rose: The Passion and Courage</h1>
    <img src="rose.jpg" alt="Rose image" />
    <div>
        <p class="flower1">Like the flower itself, the history of the rose is very colorful. Roses have been naturally
            growing for over 35 million years! However, they were not known to be cultivated until about 5,000 years
            ago. Their usage began not just as a decorative touch to one home, but they were also used for medicinal
            purposes and to make perfumes, and their petals were even used as confetti for festive occasions. Getting
            your roses into
            water quickly is the first step in caring for them. Fill a vase three-fourths full of fresh, cool tap water.
            The roses will absorb the water, soaking up the nutrients that will travel up to the bloom and create a
            lively flower. Check the water level in your rose vase every day and add more water as needed.

    <h2>Sunflower: Constancy and Faith</h2>
    <img src="./images/sunflower.jpg" alt="Sunflowers image" />
    <span> Sunflowers are one of the most popular flower types and are best known for their dazzling yellow color and
        large size. They generally symbolize adoration, loyalty, and longevity in the language of flowers. Native
        Americans view sunflowers as a symbol of harvest and bounty since the flower provides seeds and pigments, in
        addition to being visually beautiful. Sunflowers need direct sunlight for six to eight hours per day and require
        hot conditions to flower well. Sunflowers also have long roots that require plenty of room to spread out, so
        soil should be well dug and not too dense for growth. Avoid over-fertilization or risk your stems breaking in
        the fall. In addition to being great in a garden, sunflowers make great gifts and look wonderful in bouquets.

    <h3>Hyacinths: Joy and Sincerity</h3>
    <img src="https://www.1800flowers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/4895087-most_popular_flowers_Hyacinth-1024x235.jpg.webp"
        alt="Hyacinths Flower image" />
    <div>
        <p class="flower2"> Hyacinths, with their powerfully sweet scent, are popular spring bulbs native to eastern
            Mediterranean countries, including Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. Today, about 60 cultivars exist, with white,
            pink, red, purple, or blue flowers that grow in a tight column along short stems. Hyacinths can easily be
            grown outside in the garden or in containers, or indoors in pots. After planting, can take upwards of three
            months for them to establish a root system, but once established and blooming, they will reward you with
            pretty colors and a sweet scent.
